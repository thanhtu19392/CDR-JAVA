# CDR-JAVA

This is a project using Java for the implementation of a portfolio whose credit risk management plays the most important role and on how we manage to improve the accuracy as well as the runtime savings by using importance sampling method. The portfolio contains 3 types of total 140 exposures. Any details can be found in the report (pdf). 

### How to run? 
+> For implementing portfolio with Cholesky/Eigenvalue method, do it with MainCorreCholesky/MainCorreEigenvalue  \\
+> Take a try with importance sampling method, run it with MainImportanceSampling.

### Requirement for library? 
During this project we have been using [JAMA](https://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/) for matrix calculation and [apache.common.math3](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/download_math.cgi)
